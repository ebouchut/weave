# weave

Entity-level semantic merge driver for Git. Resolves false conflicts that Git's line-based merge creates when multiple agents (or humans) edit the same file on different branches.

## The Problem

Git merges by comparing **lines**. When two branches both add code to the same file — even to completely different functions — Git sees overlapping line ranges and declares a conflict:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
export function validateToken(token: string): boolean {
    return token.length > 0 && token.startsWith("sk-");
}
=======
export function formatDate(date: Date): string {
    return date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
}
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

These are **completely independent changes**. There's no real conflict. But someone has to manually resolve it anyway.

This happens constantly when multiple AI agents work on the same codebase. Agent A adds a function, Agent B adds a different function to the same file, and Git halts everything for a human to intervene.

## How Weave Fixes This

Weave replaces Git's line-based merge with **entity-level merge**. Instead of diffing lines, it:

1. Parses all three versions (base, ours, theirs) into semantic entities — functions, classes, JSON keys, etc. — using [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/)
2. Matches entities across versions by identity (name + type + scope)
3. Merges at the entity level:
   - **Different entities changed** → auto-resolved, no conflict
   - **Same entity changed by both** → attempts intra-entity merge, conflicts only if truly incompatible
   - **One side modifies, other deletes** → flags a meaningful conflict

The same scenario above? Weave merges it cleanly with zero conflicts — both functions end up in the output.

## Weave vs Git Merge

| Scenario | Git (line-based) | Weave (entity-level) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Two agents add different functions to same file | **CONFLICT** | Auto-resolved |
| Agent A modifies `foo()`, Agent B adds `bar()` | **CONFLICT** (adjacent lines) | Auto-resolved |
| Both agents modify the same function differently | CONFLICT | CONFLICT (with entity-level context) |
| One agent modifies, other deletes same function | CONFLICT (cryptic diff) | CONFLICT: `function 'validateToken' (modified in ours, deleted in theirs)` |
| Both agents add identical function | **CONFLICT** | Auto-resolved (identical content detected) |
| Different JSON keys modified | **CONFLICT** | Auto-resolved |

The key difference: Git produces false conflicts on **independent changes** because they happen to be in the same file. Weave only conflicts on **actual semantic collisions** — when two branches change the same entity incompatibly.

## Conflict Markers

When a real conflict occurs, weave gives you context that Git doesn't:

```
<<<<<<< ours — function `process` (both modified)
export function process(data: any) {
    return JSON.stringify(data);
}
=======
export function process(data: any) {
    return data.toUpperCase();
}
>>>>>>> theirs — function `process` (both modified)
```

You immediately know: what entity conflicted, what type it is, and why it conflicted.

## Supported Languages

TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, JSON, YAML, TOML, Markdown. Falls back to standard line-level merge for unsupported file types.

## Setup

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# In your repo:
./target/release/weave-cli setup

# Or manually:
git config merge.weave.name "Entity-level semantic merge"
git config merge.weave.driver "/path/to/weave-driver %O %A %B %L %P"
echo "*.ts *.tsx *.js *.py *.go *.rs *.json *.yaml *.toml *.md merge=weave" >> .gitattributes
```

Then use Git normally. `git merge` will use weave automatically for configured file types.

## Preview

Dry-run a merge to see what weave would do:

```bash
weave-cli preview feature-branch
```

```
  src/utils.ts — auto-resolved
    unchanged: 2, added-ours: 1, added-theirs: 1
  src/api.ts — 1 conflict(s)
    ✗ function `process`: both modified

✓ Merge would be clean (1 file(s) auto-resolved by weave)
```

## Architecture

```
weave-core       # Library: entity extraction, 3-way merge algorithm, reconstruction
weave-driver     # Git merge driver binary (called by git via %O %A %B %L %P)
weave-cli        # CLI: `weave-cli setup` and `weave-cli preview`
```

Uses [sem-core](https://github.com/Ataraxy-Labs/sem) for entity extraction via tree-sitter grammars.

## How It Works

```
         base
        /    \
     ours    theirs
        \    /
       weave merge
```

1. **Parse** all three versions into semantic entities via tree-sitter
2. **Extract regions** — alternating entity and interstitial (imports, whitespace) segments
3. **Match entities** across versions by ID (file:type:name:parent)
4. **Resolve** each entity: one-side-only changes win, both-changed attempts intra-entity 3-way merge
5. **Reconstruct** file from merged regions, preserving ours-side ordering
6. **Fallback** to line-level merge for files >1MB, binary files, or unsupported types
